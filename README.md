# Real-Time Stock Price Monitoring and Visualization System

## Project Overview
This project aims to build a real-time stock price monitoring and visualization system using Apache Kafka, MongoDB, and Streamlit. The system will fetch live stock price data from a free API (e.g., Alpha Vantage), process it using Kafka, store it in MongoDB, and visualize the data using Streamlit and Plotly. The dashboard will provide insights into stock price changes, trading volume, and other relevant metrics.

## Key Components
1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Use a free stock market API (e.g., Alpha Vantage) to fetch live stock price data.
   - Implement a Kafka producer to send the live data to a Kafka topic.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Implement a Kafka consumer to read the data from the Kafka topic.
   - Store the processed data in MongoDB for persistent storage.

3. **Data Visualization**:
   - Use Streamlit to create an interactive web-based dashboard.
   - Use Plotly to create dynamic and interactive visualizations (e.g., line charts, candlestick charts) for stock price trends, volume, and other metrics.

4. **System Architecture**:
   - **Kafka Producer**: Fetches live stock data and sends it to a Kafka topic.
   - **Kafka Consumer**: Reads data from the Kafka topic and stores it in MongoDB.
   - **MongoDB**: Acts as the database to store historical and real-time stock data.
   - **Streamlit Dashboard**: Provides a user-friendly interface to visualize and analyze stock data.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Apache Kafka**: For real-time data streaming and processing.
- **MongoDB**: For storing and managing stock data.
- **Streamlit**: For building the interactive dashboard.
- **Plotly**: For creating interactive and dynamic visualizations.
- **Python**: Primary programming language for implementing the system.
- **Alpha Vantage API** (or similar): For fetching live stock market data.

## Features
- Real-time stock price updates.
- Historical data storage and retrieval.
- Interactive visualizations for stock price trends, volume, and other metrics.
- User-friendly dashboard for monitoring and analysis.

## Workflow
1. Fetch live stock data using the API.
2. Send the data to a Kafka topic using a Kafka producer.
3. Consume the data using a Kafka consumer and store it in MongoDB.
4. Retrieve data from MongoDB and display it on the Streamlit dashboard.
5. Use Plotly to create interactive charts and graphs for visualization.

## Expected Outcomes
- A fully functional real-time stock price monitoring system.
- A dashboard that provides insights into stock price changes and trading volume.
- Scalable architecture for handling large volumes of stock data.

## Future Enhancements
- Add support for multiple stock exchanges and markets.
- Implement alerts and notifications for significant price changes.
- Integrate machine learning models for stock price prediction.
- Enhance the dashboard with additional metrics and visualizations.
